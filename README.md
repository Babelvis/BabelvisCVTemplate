# BabelVisCV

This project can be regarded as a major rewrite of the original FortySecondsCV
class. [project](https://github.com/PandaScience/FortySecondsCV)

## Description

BabelVis CV class for LaTeX

Just try it yourself starting from `template.tex`!

## Requirements

You need to compile your document with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX in order to have
the latest Font Awesome icons (`fontawesome5`) and Academicons. If you still
want to compile with pdfLaTeX for whatever reason, Academicons won't be
available.

If you want to use [gosquared's flag icon set](https://github.com/gosquared/flags),
make sure to first run

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
